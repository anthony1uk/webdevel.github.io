- After you have done everything so far, you should see something similar to the following image when you open your index.html in a browser:
[[./img/page-8.png]]
There are several things we can do to improve this page:
- Leave some space between the boxes
- Leave some space between the text and image from the border of the two boxes
- Add an image to fill the blank space in the topbox
- Make the heading "My Dog Jack" bigger
- Change the page's background colour from white to something more interesting

- Space between boxes - add space between the topbox and the container.
Let's examine the box model below: A box has top, buttom, left or right margin. By default all the four margins are zero.
- The model shows that the top margin is what we need to achieve the space between the topbox and the container which contains the left and right box inside it.
 
#+begin_src html
margin-top: 10px;
#+end_src

- Can you work out, independently, where to put the line =margin-top: 10px;=?

- Lets add some space between the left and the right boxes.
- If we add a margin using the right box, we will use its left margin; if we add a margin using the left box, we use its right margin.
- /Important note:/ if we add a margin to a box, it will move to make room for the added margin. 
- For example: if we add 10px of margin-left to the right box, it will move 10px to the right. This may result in the right box moving outside the big container and mess up our layout! 
- To solve this problem, we need to decrease the width of the right box by 10px so that it will remain inside the container.


- Before adding the margin:
#+begin_src html
#rightbox {
width: 640px;
height: 600px;
background-color: grey;
float: right;
} 
#+end_src


- After adding the margin:

#+begin_src html
#rightbox {
width: 630px;
height: 600px;
background-color: grey;
float: right;
margin-left; 10px;
}
#+end_src

- Can you work out what changes made and why? If your image is out of place, can you fix it independently?

- Let's add space between the content (text and image) and the box border.
- We'll start by taking a look at what we have so far...
[[./img/page-9.png]]
- The hyperlinks inside the leftbox are too close to the borders of the box. We need to add some space between the box border and the hyperlinks.
[[./img/box-model.gif]]
- The model (above) shows that the padding is what we need to achieve the space between the box border and the content. Just as margin, padding also has four sides: left, right, top and buttom. After some experimenting, I found the following works best for me: 

#+begin_src html
padding-top: 40px; 
padding-left: 10px;
padding-buttom: 20px;
padding-right: 10px;
#+end_src

- Can you work out, independently, where to put the above lines?

- Decide on a topic you would like to make webpages about it.
- Your topic could be pets, movies, games, your favourite football teams, music bands, etc.
- Design your webpage layout using Paint or Word shapes tool.
- Your design must be different from the tutorial one. Annotate each element on your design. For example, a picture of my dog, or general information about my dog. etc
- Build your webpages one at a time based on the layout you designed. You need at least two pages that are linked.
- Build the webpages using Notepad or SublimeText if available. If you are stuck, go to appropriate sections in the tutorials for instructions.


- Once finished, write an evaluation of your project:
  - Is your design suitable for its purpose?
  - Is your design suitable for its intended audience?
  - Are all links correct?
  - Are the choices of colour, fonts, images appropriate?
  - Work independently and hand in your project at the end of term.


- *Silver:* Create two inter-linked web pages using HTML.
- *Gold:* Use CSS to style the pages.
- *Platinum:* Use CSS with padding and margins to create your pages.
