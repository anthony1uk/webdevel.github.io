- Create a second web page just like what you have done with the web page =index.html=. If you forgot how to do it, just go back and follow the instructions. Save your second page as =mySecondPage.html= inside the same folder as your =index.html=.

- This is my second page. Yours may be different:
[[./img/page-2.png]]
- You should now have two html files in your folder:
[[./img/folder-2.png]]
- We add a hyperlink on the body of our first web page to link it to our second web page.
- Type a line like the following in your *first* web page:

#+begin_src html
<a href="mySecondWebPage.html">Click here to see many photos when Jack growing up!</a>
#+end_src

- In between the =<a>= and =</a>= tags is where you put the hyperlinked text. A hyperlinked text when clicked will take you to another page. In this we want to go to our second web page.

- The =href= is called an attribute. An attribute is used to give more information about a tag. In this case it tells the browser where our second page is. href stands for hypertext reference.
- The new line for the link must be placed somewhere inside the body pairs.

#+begin_src html
<head>
<title>My Dog Jack</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>My dog Jack is a minature schnauzer. He is 8 months old.</p>
<a href="mySecondWebPage.html">Click here to see many photos when Jack growing up!</a>
</body>
</html>
#+end_src

- After you added the hyperlink in your =index.html= file, save it. Go to your folder,open the =index.html= file by either double clicking on it or right click then choose Open with a browser of your choice. You should see something similar to the image shown below. 
[[./img/page-3.png]]
- Test if the hyperlink works by clicking on it. You know it is working if your second page opens up in a browser window.
- After you added the hyperlink in your =index.html= file and have tested it successfully, try to add a hyperlink in your second web page that links to your first page independently first.
